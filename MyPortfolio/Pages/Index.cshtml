                <p>Hello! I'm Konrad Glowacki, a recent Computing graduate from the University of Bolton, on track to graduate with a First Class Degree. 
                    I have a strong passion for data analysis and software development. Throughout my academic journey, I've developed proficiency in various programming languages ​​
                    and frameworks, including Python, Java, SQL, NoSQL, R, C#, and Blazor. My final-year project involved applying Machine Learning techniques to create predictive models, 
                    which I then integrated into a web application, demonstrating my practical experience and problem-solving skills.</p>

                <p>I am dedicated to continuous learning and staying abreast of the latest technological advancements. My goal is to contribute to innovative solutions that have a 
                    real impact. Whether it's tackling complex algorithms, optimising databases, or developing intuitive applications, I approach each challenge with meticulous attention to 
                    detail and a proactive attitude.</p>

                <p>I invite you to explore my portfolio to see the projects I've worked on.</p>

                        <h4>The Lending Library Management System</h4>
                        <p>
                            The Lending Library Management System is my first programming project, and was written in Java. This project enables the management of member registrations, book inventories
                            and loan records, enabling the library to effectively track its operations. Created using the Eclipse IDE, this project implements core object-oriented principles
                            such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism, providing a scalable and easy-to-maintain code base. Key features include adding and removing members and books,
                            searching records, and managing loan transactions.

                    <h4>Interactive Corridor Display System</h4>
                        <p>
                            The Interactive Corridor Display System is a project aimed at enhancing the corridor of the School of Arts & Digital Technologies in University of Bolton with modern,
                            interactive display solutions. The system includes two types of screens: large corridor carousel screens and smaller room timetable screens.
                            The corridor carousel screens display a rotating carousel of information relevant to computing students, such as text, animations, graphics, and video clips.
                            The content is prioritized and scheduled with specific display durations, embargo dates, and expiry dates, and supports various transition effects and
                            customisable text layouts.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The room timetable screens are placed outside each classroom door and display real-time information about the current and upcoming classes, including the start and end times,
                            module name and code, and lecturer details. These screens also show the room name and a short biography of the person the room is named after.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The project was developed using Visual Studio 2022 and the C# programming language, leveraging the .NET 7 framework. The UI was built using the ASP.NET Blazor framework,
                            while the Entity Framework was used for back-end database access and management with MS SQL Server. For authentication and authorization, ASP.NET Identity was employed.
                            Additionally, ASP.NET Web API was used to create RESTful API endpoints. The system includes a staff admin interface with role-based access control, allowing authorised
                            staff to manage content and user accounts securely.

                    <h4>Machine Learning Credit Card Fraud Detection System</h4>
                    <p>
                        The Machine Learning Credit Card Fraud Detection System is a project aimed at identifying fraudulent credit card transactions.
                        This system leverages machine learning algorithms to analyze transaction patterns and detect anomalies indicative of fraudulent activity.
                        Developed using Python and key libraries such as Scikit-Learn, Pandas, and NumPy, the project incorporates various data preprocessing techniques, and model
                        training processes to achieve high accuracy in fraud detection.
                        The system utilises a combination of supervised learning algorithms, including Logistic Regression, 'Support Vector Machine, K-Nearest Neighbors , Decision Tree,
                        Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting, to classify transactions as legitimate or fraudulent. Additionally, the project employs performance metrics such as precision,
                        recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix to evaluate and compare the effectiveness of different models.

                    <p>
                        This project I have developed a comprehensive machine learning model to predict property prices in the United Kingdom.
                        I used 3 datasets that were thoroughly cleaned and pre-processed to ensure data quality, including handling missing values, correcting inconsistencies,
                        and standardising data formats to create a robust dataset for analysis. The next stage of the project was to combine these three datasets to create a solid basis
                        for further analysis and to increase descriptive property characteristics.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The project then moved to the application development phase, during which a user-friendly application was created using Python and the Flask framework.
                        This app allows users to enter property characteristics and receive real-time property value forecasts. The app is designed to be intuitive and accessible,
                        making it a great tool for real estate investors and potential home owners who want to make informed decisions in the real estate market.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        This two-phase approach not only demonstrates the practical application of machine learning theory in real-world scenarios, but also demonstrates
                        the integration of data science and software development skills to create a functional tool.
